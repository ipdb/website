## Introduction

These policies apply to your use of this website and to information you submit through this website. Use of the IPDB network is subject to its own Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

We collect and use information in accordance with the German Telemedia Act (Telemediengesetz) and (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz), or with your express consent. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18 without permission from a parent or guardian.

## What information we collect and how we use it

We may log information about your visit to this site (your IP address, browser version, and so on) so we can improve the site and keep it secure.

If you submit information through the forms on this site, we will collect the information you submit. We may use that information to contact you or to improve IPDB.

## How we store information

We may use cloud service providers to store information. Information may be stored outside of the European Union, but we only use providers that comply with the US-EU [Privacy Shield](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/eu-us-privacy-shield/index_en.htm). Right now we use the following providers, which each have their own privacy policies:

* Google Apps for email and internal document sharing ([Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/)).
* Mailchimp for mailing lists ([Privacy Policy](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/)).
* 3Scale for the Test Network user portal ([Privacy Policy](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/privacy-statement)).

## How information is shared

We will not share or sell the identifiable personal information we collect or generate except as we explain in this section.

We may share non-personal or aggregate information, such as usage statistics for the site.

## Cookies

We only use one cookie: [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/). It provides information about how you use the site so we can make it better. We respect the [Do Not Track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) header. You can block tracking cookies entirely by installing a browser add-on such as [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) or [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock).

## Updating or deleting your personal information

We will update or delete your personal information if you ask us to unless we are under a legal obligation to keep it. Just email us at contact@ipdb.global.

## Legal requests

We may be required to disclose information to comply with the law or processes such as warrants or court orders. [Watch our canary](/canary/).

## Open door policy

We believe privacy policies should be easy to read and make sense to non-lawyers. If something isn't clear or if you have questions, email us at contact@ipdb.global.
